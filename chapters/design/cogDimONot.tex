Notes: 
- Tool for engineers
- avoids 'death by detail'

- CDs presented as a VOCABULARY for design discussion
- 'things experienced designers might have noticed' - now have a term/name
- No perfect interface - reflects set of tradeoffs
- improvement on one dimension lead to downgrade in another

- Information artefact -> notation <- environment
  - helper device - *postit note"
  - redefinition device - changes main notaion in some way

evaluation procedure: - by Green and Blackwell
1. Identify main notations - medium nad environment
2. Identify sub-devices - helper and redefinition devices
3. Concider notatoins by list of dimensions
   - usability problems, e.g. high velocity is bad for explorativity
4. Consider design manoeuvers for identified problems
