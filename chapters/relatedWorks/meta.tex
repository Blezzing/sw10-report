Before we design our framework, we consider other frameworks that attempt to reach similar goals. This allow us to make more informed decisions when we design our framework, as we then know how others have approached similar problems, and what their result was. We also see different ways of abstracting the underlying architecture, giving inspiration for our API design.

%We consider related work to be able to have a better understanding of different problems and solutions that other have encountered while creating GPGPU frameworks. We will select relevant frameworks, and interesting topics where others previous experience can help us.
