\section{Execute .PTX} \label{cha:execPtx}
\todo{Brug af CUDA driver API}

% Motivation
Executing PTX code on the GPU is a central part of \textit{YAGAL}'s functionality, and the library must therefore interact with the \textit{CUDA} driver API. All CUDA related code in \textit{YAGAL} are contained within the \texttt{yagal::cuda} namespace. 

% Implementation
To execute the \textit{PTX} code, it is passed to the function \texttt{executePtxWithParams} as a string, along with a vector containing the input parameters as seen on Listing \ref{code:executePtxWithParams}. The line number references in this section refers this listing.

To ensure that the GPU is ready, the \texttt{initIfNeeded()} function at line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:init} is called which creates a \textit{CUDA} context if one does not already exists.

At line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:crtMd} a \textit{CUDA} module is created by calling \texttt{cuModuleLoadDataEx()}, which is part of the \textit{CUDA C} API. It takes \textit{PTX} code as a \texttt{C-string}, and outputs to the provided module container.

A function handle is needed in order to determine which function within the module to execute. The handle is identified by calling \texttt{cuModuleGetFunction()} at line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:handle}. Here a function called \texttt{kernel} is requested from within the module. \texttt{kernel} is the hardcoded name of a function that is created by \textit{YAGAL}.

Predetermined block and grid dimensions are set through line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:cfgStart} to \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:cfgEnd}. This part will be refactored such that dimensions are based upon the data instead of being hardcoded.
\todo{Remember to refactor this}

The module is executed on the GPU at line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:launch} by a call to the function \texttt{cuLaunchKernel} and the module is then unloaded at line \ref{code:executePtxWithParams:clean} by \texttt{cuModuleUnload()}. The module have now been executed and the functionality within it is not needed anymore, therefore the module is unloaded.
