\section{Development Process}\label{cha:developmentProcess}
In section \ref{cha:tasks}, we define the tasks that need to be done to reach the goals in our problem statement. These tasks have a linear dependency which motivates us to follow a waterfall inspired development process. This process is separated into two major parts; Design and implementation of our framework, and comparison between our framework and other frameworks. 

During design and implementation, some features might be iterated multiple times, but when this happens it will be made clear. Before we start the comparison part, we will have completed the design and implementation part.

The implementation was done in incremental steps. Each step corresponds to a implementation of a feature that is a foundation for upcoming steps. The implementation is explained throughout chapter \ref{cha:frameworkImplementation}.

%The parts each cover multiple sub parts, chosen to perform the tasks mentioned in Chapter \ref{cha:tasks}. The report follows the structure of these parts to document the process.\todo{g√∏r dette sandt.} The parts and sub parts consist of:
