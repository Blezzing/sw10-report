\section{Motivation}
In our SW9 project we experienced that it is difficult to get started with OpenCL/CUDA development. There are multiple new concepts to learn, such as the programming model with kernels, and the memory model of the GPU. This means that a developer who believe, that the performance of an application can be improved by utilizing a GPU, need to learn all of this before being able to test his theory. This is difficult and we want to be able to initially abstract away all most of the GPU computing model until the developer is ready to learn it.
