\section{Language Selection}\label{cha:languageSelection}
In our previous semester project\cite{sw9Report}, we compared multiple languages with frameworks supporting development targeting the GPU. We observed how \textit{CUDA} and \textit{OpenCL} are the frameworks that offer the most explicit device control, and as such can be the choice for developers with knowledge of how to fine tune a GPGPU application.

As our goal of this project is making a framework to make initial GPGPU applications, where our framework can be replaced by another framework with a more low level programming model when the developer is ready for that, it is very convenient to keep our framework in the same language as those. As \textit{CUDA} and \textit{OpenCL} are used from \textit{C++} and \textit{C} we want to look at those. The abstractions allowed in \textit{C++}, in the form of templates and lambdas, makes it more attractive for us, as we want to provide high level abstractions. As such \textit{C++} is our language of choice, and the framework we create in this project will be based on \textit{C++}.
