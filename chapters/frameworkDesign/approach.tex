\section{Design Approach}
We consider the framework as a combination of two entities; the API and architecture.

The API is the front end of the framework, which is what the developer is going to see when using the framework. Designing the API is the task of defining the programming model of the framework, including what functions and types are presented to the developer. The API design dictates the usage and learning experience of the developer, and many principles exist to guide the development of this part. \todo{refer to previous chapter where we hopefully will define some of these principles.}

The architecture is the structure of the framework, its run-time environment, its compilation process, and platform support. Architectural design decisions will impact
