The design of the framework, including API and architecture, is described in this chapter. The thought process behind decisions are included here to provide reasoning for the choices when multiple options are present.

%We make decisions, not war!
%
%Language choice:
%C/C++ is the language in focus since it interfaces directly to OpenCL/CUDA, which in turn makes it easier for the developer to substitute the library use with OpenCL/CUDA later in their development process. 
%
%Library design:
%The library is developed following the principles of Cognitive Dimension of Notations. 
%\todo[inline]{Måske også Standard C++ Library Design Guidelines fra isocpp.org, eller revurderede kriterier fra sidste semester}
%
%Implementation plan:
%Using LLVM’s abillity to provide Code Generation from llvm IR to PTX, and using the library to emmit llvm IR.
