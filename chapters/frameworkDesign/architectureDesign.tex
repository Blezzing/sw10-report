\section{Architecture Design}
In this section we discuss the design decisions made regarding the architecture of \textit{YAGAL}, including use of external technologies, and compatibility.

\subsection{Using LLVM and CUDA Driver API}
In related works in chapter \ref{cha:relatedWorks} we see that there are frameworks which use \textit{LLVM} to build a compiler that output either \textit{PTX} or \textit{SPIR} code. We also see that there are frameworks that, without a compiler, generate \textit{OpenCL} code. We have not found any frameworks that, without a compiler, translates to \textit{CUDA} or \textit{PTX}. This is interesting, and we want to attempt this, to figure out why that can be.

A part of \textit{LLVM} is the intermediate language, known as \textit{LLVM Intermediate Representation}. It is designed to be higher level than most assembly languages, and is used by \textit{LLVM} as a source of compilation when compiling to a final target, such as \textit{PTX}. \textit{LLVM Intermediate Representation} is a higher level language than \textit{PTX}, and is thereby easier to generate code for. The idiomatic use of \textit{LLVM} is to build a compiler with the passes provided by the \textit{LLVM}, and additional passes defined by the compiler developer, but as we want to avoid building a compiler that a developer is forced to use to be able to utilize our framework, we can not do this. Instead we want to use the \textit{LLVM} framework by including it in our library in such a way, that the user of \textit{YAGAL} compiles the necessary components of \textit{LLVM} into her executable. This allows us to generate \textit{LLVM Intermediate Representation} and use one of \textit{LLVM}s back-ends to target \textit{PTX} inside the \textit{YAGAL} library.

When we can generate \textit{PTX} code we can focus on executing it, which is done using the \textit{CUDA Driver API}. The \textit{CUDA Driver API} differs from the \textit{CUDA Runtime API} by being slightly more verbose, but allowing \textit{PTX} to be invoked, and not requiring the \textit{NVIDIA} compiler. Using the \textit{LLVM} library in conjunction with the \textit{CUDA Driver API} allows us to handle code generation and execution without requiring a specific compiler.

Using the \textit{LLVM} library and the \textit{CUDA Driver API} does impose dependencies that the developer is required to have available. While the compiler choice is still up to the developer, the need to install these two libraries is still present as a prerequisite to using \textit{YAGAL}.

Figure \ref{fig:architectureOverview} illustrates an overview of \textit{YAGAL}. We show that the source is clean \textit{C++} with nothing but \textit{YAGAL} library inclusion. This source, when compiled, results in an executable that contains the logic of the program, together with the \textit{YAGAL} logic to both generate \textit{LLVM Intermediate Representation} and manage memory, together with the \textit{LLVM Translator} which translates the \textit{LLVM Intermediate Representation} to \textit{PTX}. The run-time requirement of a \textit{CUDA Driver} is present as it is the part that facilitates memory management and code execution on the GPU.

\subsection{CUDA Compatibility}
In cases where programs are unable to be expressed in \textit{YAGAL}, we want to provide a fall back solution. We will do this through letting the developer execute arbitrary \textit{PTX} code, through the \textit{CUDA Driver API}. To allow this we want our abstractions to provide access to the relevant device pointers to the GPU.

This solution still require the developer to have \textit{PTX} code that solves the problem. Normally this would mean writing \textit{CUDA} code, and compile that to \textit{PTX}, which is a long workaround. As such it is not ideal, but we decide that it is better to provide a problematic workaround, rather than none.
