\section{Architecture Design}
In this section we discuss the decisions made regarding the architecture of \textit{YAGAL}, including compilation method, run time, and compatibility.

\subsection{Using LLVM and CUDA Driver API}
\todo{llvm ptx back end, and cuda to execute ptx}
\todo{related works that use llvm make a special purpose compiler}
\todo{non compiler related works only target opencl}

\subsection{Compilation and Run Time Requirements}
\todo{any compiler, requiring llvm libraries and cuda driver api libraries}

\subsection{CUDA Compatibility}
\todo{let internal pointers be accessible}
