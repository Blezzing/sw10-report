\section{Compilation Time}
%\todo{it sucks, llvm is big, compile in multiple units and link instead, maybe more troublesome for developers to include then.}

We implemented a subset of \textit{LLVM LLC}, as described in section \ref{sec:llcReplacement}, in order to translate \textit{LLVM IR} to \textit{PTX} code. The consequence of this decision came in the form of additional compilation time. Even though we have stripped most of the functionality of \textit{LLVM LLC} to only contain the \textit{PTX} conversion, the inclusion of \textit{LLVM} headers still causes significant overhead during compilation.

We have two proposals as to how to overcome the extra overhead for compilation of programs using \textit{YAGAL}. We could further strip the included \textit{LLVM} headers, or we could bundle precompiled binaries of our reimplementation of {LLVM LLC} with \textit{YAGAL}.

\subsection{Stripped Headers}
The reimplementation of \textit{LLVM LLC} was stripped of anything unrelated to the conversion of \textit{LLVM IR} to \textit{PTX} code, but there are still significant overhead. This is due to the \textit{LLVM LLC}'s dependency to the rest of \textit{LLVM}. To further reduce the compilation overhead, a step deeper could be taken in order to investigate the headers used by \textit{LLVM LLC} and strip those of any unneeded functionality.

%We do not know extend this could go, blablabla.. skiv noget mere om hvorfor det er dumt, men det hele er nu contained eller noget.

\subsection{Precompiled binaries}
Our reimplementation of \textit{LLVM LLC} could be precompiled and bundled with \textit{YAGAL}. This would severely cut down the compilation time, since there is no longer a need for a developer to compile it every time she compiles a \textit{YAGAL} program. This would however require a developer to actively link to the binaries when compiling a \textit{YAGAL} program.
