\section{General Comparison}
The General part of the comparison serves as a static metric for comparison of the frameworks. It will show how each of the frameworks perform, and will be used to show how \textit{YAGAL} competes against these. 

The general part of the comparison consists of:
\begin{description}
\item[Performance]\hfill\\
Compare the execution time of a demo application.
\item[Lines of code]\hfill\\
Count how many lines of code necessary for the implementation of the demo application.
\item[Size of executable]\hfill\\
Compare how much a given framework influences the size of the final executable.
\end{description}
