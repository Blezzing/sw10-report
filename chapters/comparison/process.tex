\section{Comparison Process}
% Comparison categories?
We have constructed our own methodology for the comparison of \textit{YAGAL} and the related works. Because we want to investigate how \textit{YAGAL} performs against the related works and how usable it is, the comparison have been split in two parts; one that covers a general performance aspect, consisting of static comparisons, and in the second part we make use of \textit{Cognitive Dimensions of Notations} to construct a vocabulary for for evaluation of usability of \textit{YAGAL} and the related works.

% How will we do it
The evaluation and comparison will be made based on a demo application that are implemented in each of the frameworks. First the static parameters are recorded, then the usability is evaluated which is done for each of the implementations. The findings of the evaluations are then compared to each other in the final section of this chapter.
