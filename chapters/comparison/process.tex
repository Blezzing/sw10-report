\section{Comparison Process}
% Comparison categories?
We want to investigate how \textit{YAGAL} performs against the related works and how usable it is. To do this we have split the comparison in two parts; one that covers the superficial qualities, being those that are easy to measure and compare, and in the second part we make use of \textit{Cognitive Dimensions of Notations} to construct a vocabulary for evaluation of the usability.

% How will we do it
The evaluation and comparison will be done based on a demo application that are implemented in each of the frameworks. First the superficial qualities are recorded, then the usability is evaluated which is done for each of the implementations. The findings of the evaluations are then compared to each other in the final section of this chapter.

% What we will compare
